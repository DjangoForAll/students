Hi I’m Nubaise, a student at NIT Calicut and a beginner in open-source contributions.
I have hands-on experience with the MERN stack and strong frontend skills, working with React, JavaScript/TypeScript,
and Tailwind CSS. I’m currently learning Next.js and exploring Web3 and DevOps to better understand 
modern application development and deployment.
My aim in open source is to build meaningful, long-term connections, learn from experienced contributors, 
and consistently contribute to real projects. Over time, I hope this helps me grow into a remote-ready developer 
working with global teams.
