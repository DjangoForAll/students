# Hello world ðŸ‘‹

### About me
I am a pre-final year CS undergrad student and a full-stack web developer who is passionate about exploring the latest technologies. I have won multiple hackathons and am an active open source contributor. I am currently exploring DevOps and Blockchain technologies. Also interested in open source and Linux in general.

### Project
My best project as of right now is [Dodging Turtis](https://github.com/Dodging-Turtis/Dodging-Turtis), which is a NFT based game and marketplace built using:
 - Nextjs, TailwindCSS and Phaser 3 for the frontend
 - Mobx, Web3.js for data fetching and state management
 - Serverless Functions along with NextAuth and MongoDB for the backend
 
 This project was built initally during the ETHOdyssey hackathon and is currently continued with the help of microgrants by Polygon and Filecoin.
 
 *PS: It is still in progress and the readme and the site url are completely outdated.*
