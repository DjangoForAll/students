I'm an undergraduate engineer and open source contributor with a keen intrest in building open source tools that help people. I love to learn new things. I am a strong believer in open source software and I try my best to contribute back to my commuity with open sourced projects. My Tech Stack consists of React, Typescript, Node, Flask, Django and a bunch of other cool stuff.
