### Akshat Rawat

I am a full stack developer, and a 3rd year student of SRMIST. I have experience with MERN stack, Python, Flutter and Firebase. Apart from that I have also ventured into the fields of Blockchain, in which I have completed 3 projects. My latest project was `CrowdFund`, a decentralized crowdfunding platform built on Ethereum Blockchain. Moreover I am also fond of open source projects and would try to contribute more and more, moving forward.
