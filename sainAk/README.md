### Aakash Singh
I'm a third year CSE under grad. I love working with python and linux, but recently I've be working with tailwind and javascript and that got me hooked. I have a keen interest in exploring new frameworks and technologies. My best project is [Flaam](https://github.com/flaam-org/flaam-api) it is a platform for developers and ideators to collaborate and make amazing stuff.
