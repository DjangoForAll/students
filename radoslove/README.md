ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm RadosÅ‚aw Kaczmarczyk


I'm a passionate and curious developer with a background in pharmacy and a strong interest in technology, databases, and system administration. 

I work on web applications, containerized environments, and database-driven systemsâ€”often with a focus on healthcare and pharmacy-related tools. I enjoy solving real-world problems through code and experimenting with my homelab setups (Raspberry Pi, Ubuntu servers, and more).



ðŸ”§ Tech I'm into:
Python | PHP | JavaScript | MySQL | Docker | Linux | Git | Kubernetes (learning)



ðŸ’¡ Currently exploring:

Full-stack app deployment

Healthcare software integrations

Kubernetes for self-hosted apps
