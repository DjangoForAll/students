# Hello World!
I'm Abhinav Thota. I am a recent grad from University of British Columbia, Canada.
I really enjoy web development, and want to get better at backend development.
I also want to become an open source contributor and think that OHC is an amazing community.

## Fun Fact
I actually grew up in a country called Brunei for most of my life, and would
come and stay with my grandparents in Hyderabad every summer!
