# Hey, this is Krishna!

I'm a CSE undergrad with a passion for computer science and anything related to it. I mostly work with Python and Javascript, while trying to learn new languages that can help me with different problems. 

I'm familiar with the web development process, the frameworks associated with it (Express.js, Flask, Oracle SQL, Sqlite, MySQL, Redis and React) and common web development concepts. I'm also fairly familiar with: 
    1. Developing CLI interfaces
    2. Scientific computing using Numpy
    3. Image processing and manipulation with OpenCV

I've built multiple webapps with React and vanilla html, css and javascript, that you can check out on my website! (https://krishnasiva.xyz)
