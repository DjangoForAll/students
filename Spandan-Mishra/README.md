# Hey there! I'm Spandan

I am a GSoC '25 Contributor working on the DIET Management in CARE project under OHC. I am taking this course to have a deep understanding about Django, since I'll be using it for my project.

Some of my best works have been the contributions to care fe, second brain project, payTM project and college football project.
