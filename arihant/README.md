Hi I am Arihant Hirawat, a software developer. I code with Javascript, Ruby, GoLang and enjoy writing unit tests. I develop web & mobile apps and build CI/CD pipelines. I am diving deep into tech stacks and equipping my skillset with the knowledge of the latest frameworks.

Apart from all these, I have my very other interest in topics related to docker containers, container orchestration tools like Kubernetes and I am learning more in-depth about them.

I love all the things that open source offers to people. It is important to me to give back to my community of developers who share their experiences, knowledge, and code.
