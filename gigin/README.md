### Gigin Chandy George
I'm a developer who loves building out ideas overnight. I work on React, Rescript, Typescript, Python, Django, Java, Spring, Flutter and anything else I can get my hands on. I try to work with a language agnostic mindset. I try to contribute to Open Source Projects whenever I can. I believe Open Source Software can make the world a better place.
